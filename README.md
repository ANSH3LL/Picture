# Picture
Firefox extension that redirects all instagram URLs to smihub.com or picuki.com per user choice

## Why
Recently, instagram has developed a nasty habit of forcing users to login before they can view user profiles (including public profiles). This extension fixes this by redirecting to one of two instagram "viewers" as chosen.

## SmiHub & Picuki don't work on firefox
This is likely because of firefox's enhanced tracking protection. Disabling it on smihub and picuki should fix this and allow images to be loaded.
