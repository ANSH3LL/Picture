# Picture
Firefox extension that redirects all instagram URLs to dumpor.com or picuki.com per user choice

### Why
Recently, instagram has developed a nasty habit of forcing users to login before they can view user profiles (including public profiles). This extension fixes this by redirecting to one of two instagram "viewers" as chosen.

### How
- Install picture and click on its icon.
- Enable usage of either dumpor or picuki.
- Visit an instagram URL as you normally would and picture will redirect you to the equivalent page on dumpor or picuki thus bypassing instagram's login requirements.
- If you want to login to instagram as you normally would, disable picture.

### Dumpor & Picuki don't work on firefox
This is likely because of firefox's enhanced tracking protection. Disabling it on dumpor and picuki should fix this and allow images to be loaded.
